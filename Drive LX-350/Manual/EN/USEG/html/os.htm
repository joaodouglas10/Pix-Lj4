<div class="body-text">
<b>bidirectional printing</b>

<br>A method of printing in which each letter or symbol is formed by a pattern (matrix) of individual dots.</div>

<div class="body-text">
<b>draft</b>
<br>The print mode used by your printer when you select Draft as the font. The Draft font uses less dots per character for faster printing.</div>

<div class="body-text">
<b>font</b>
<br>A style of type designated by a name such as Roman or Sans Serif.</div>

<div class="body-text">
<b>form feed (FF)</b>
<br>A control code and control panel button that advances the paper to the next top-of-form position.</div>

<div class="body-text">
<b>halftoning</b>
<br>A method of using dot patterns to represent an image. Halftoning makes it possible to produce varying shades of gray using only black dots, or a nearly infinite array of colors using only a few colors of dots.</div>

<div class="body-text">
<b>hex dump</b>
<br>A troubleshooting method that helps identify the cause of communication problems between the printer and the computer. When the printer is in hex dump mode, it prints each code that it receives in hexadecimal notation and ASCII characters. Also called data dump.</div>

<div class="body-text">
<b>high speed draft</b>
<br>A mode of draft printing you can select using the default-setting mode. High speed draft uses a minimum number of dots per character to produce extremely high-speed printing.</div>

<div class="body-text">
<b>interface</b>
<br>The connection between the computer and the printer over which print data is transmitted to the printer.</div>

<div class="body-text">
<b>landscape</b>
<br>Printing that is oriented sideways on the page. This orientation gives you a page that is wider than it is high and is useful for printing spreadsheets. </div>

<div class="body-text">
<b>letter quality (LQ)</b>
<br>The print mode used by your printer when a font other than Draft is selected. Printing with letter-quality fonts provides better readability and appearance at a reduced print speed. </div>

<div class="body-text">
<b>line feed (LF)</b>
<br>A control code and control panel button that advances the paper one line space.</div>

<div class="body-text">
<b>loading position</b>

<div class="body-text">
<b>proportional font</b>
<br>A font whose characters take up varying amounts of horizontal space depending on the width of the character. Thus the uppercase M takes up more horizontal space than the lowercase l.</div>

<div class="body-text">

<div class="body-text">
<b>tear-off position</b>
<br>The position the printer feeds the paper to when the auto tear-off mode is on. Using the Micro Adjust function, you can adjust the position so that the paper&rsquo;s perforation meets the printer&rsquo;s tear-off edge.</div>

<div class="body-text">
